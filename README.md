# This is about me: Andreas (Andi) Grabner

I am a CNCF Ambassador with a passion for Observability, DevOps, SRE, Platform & Performance Engineering.
I am also a DevRel at Dynatrace advocating for building better software by following an "Observability Driven Engineering" approach.
And I host a podcast with my colleague Brian Wilson called [PurePerformance](https://www.spreaker.com/show/pureperformance)
